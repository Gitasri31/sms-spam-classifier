SMS Spam Classifier(SPAM SNIPER)
This project builds a machine learning model to classify SMS messages as spam or not spam (ham). The goal is to automatically detect and filter unwanted spam messages, improving user communication experience.

The system uses text preprocessing and various machine learning algorithms like Naive Bayes, SVM, and Random Forest to achieve high accuracy in detecting spam messages. It includes evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score to measure performance.

You can use this project to understand how spam detection works, train your own models, and test SMS messages in real time.
Dataset: The SMS dataset used is publicly available and contains labeled spam and ham messages.

How to run:

Clone the repository

Install dependencies

Run the main script to train and test the model

Future work:

Add deep learning models

Build a web interface for live SMS detection
